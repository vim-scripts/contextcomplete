contextcomplete
===============

contextcomplete is a plugin that decides what kind of insert completion to use
based on the text that is before the cursor.  This is triggered by a key which
is customizable by the user.  Regexes are used to determine which type of
completion is used, which can also be defined by the user.

Installation
------------
If you don't have any other preferred installation method, I recommend using
[pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen).  Then, all you have to do is
`cd ~/.vim/bundle` and do `git clone https://github.com/4Evergreen4/vim-contextcomplete.git`

Options
-------
See `doc/contextcomplete.txt`.
