INTRODUCTION                                                  *contextcomplete*

contextcomplete is a plugin that decides what kind of |ins-completion| to use
based on the text that is before the cursor.  This is triggered by the key
specified in |g:contextcomplete_trigger|.  This key is also mapped
to cycle through all the possible options until the completion menu is
exited.  Regexes are used to determine which type of completion is used, which
can be configured using the |g:contextcomplete_detect_regexes| dictionary.
A table of possible keys for this dictionary and the related completion type
can be found at |g:contextcomplete_detect_regexes|.

CUSTOMIZATION                                   *contextcomplete-customization*

*g:contextcomplete_detect_regexes*

contextcomplete can be customized to use user defined regexes to detect what
kind of completion to use.  The first completion type specified in
|g:contextcomplete_key_order| whose associated regex matches is the
completion type that is used.  If |g:contextcomplete_detect_regexes|.ignore is
specified, it will always override any of the other completion types and make
|g:contextcomplete_trigger| behave as it normally would in insert mode.  The
same happens if none of the specified regexes match.  A table for the possible
keys in |g:contextcomplete_detect_regexes| is available below.

  Dictionary Key        Related Keystroke   Default Value ~
  lines                 i_CTRL-X_CTRL-L     None
  keywords              i_CTRL-X_CTRL-N     '\v\w{-1,}$'
  dictionary            i_CTRL-X_CTRL-K     None
  thesaurus             i_CTRL-X_CTRL-T     None
  keywords-included     i_CTRL-X_CTRL-I     None
  tags                  i_CTRL-X_CTRL-]     None
  file-names            i_CTRL-X_CTRL-F     '\v\/(\w|\-){-}$'
  macros                i_CTRL-X_CTRL-D     None
  cmdline               i_CTRL-X_CTRL-V     None
  user                  i_CTRL-X_CTRL-U     None
  omnicomplete          i_CTRL-X_CTRL-O     '\v\.\w{-}$'
  spelling              i_CTRL-X_s          None
  complete-keywords     i_CTRL-N            None
  ignore                None                '\v^\s*$'

You can find help for what kind of completion each related keystroke does by
looking it up in vim's help.  For omnicomplete, you would do: >
  :help i_CTRL-X_CTRL-O
<

The default configuration of this dictionary will use keyword completion
before a word, file name completion before a forward slash, and omnicompletion
before a dot.

Example of a configuration for detection regexes: >
  let g:contextcomplete_detect_regexes = {
      \ 'keywords': '\v<\w+>$', 'ignore': '\v^\s*$'
  \ }
<

*g:contextcomplete_key_order*

You can specify which completion types have precedence over each other using
this list.  By default, the order is: file-names, omnicomplete, keywords.
If any of the possible completion types are left out, their corresponding
completion types in |g:contextcomplete_detect_regexes| will be ignored.
Ignore will always takes precedence over any completion types in this list.

Example: >
  let g:contextcomplete_key_order = [
    \ 'lines', 'keywords', 'dictionary', 'thesaurus', 'keywords-included',
    \ 'tags', 'file-names', 'macros', 'cmdline', 'user', 'omnicomplete',
    \ 'spelling', 'complete-keywords'
  \ ]
<

*g:contextcomplete_trigger*

You can also specify which key is used to trigger contextcomplete.  This key
is also temporarily mapped to cycle throught all the completion options until
the completion menu is exited. The default value for this option is '\<Tab>'.
You must use a literal string to specify this key, which can be done by
enclosing the value in single quotes.  If you do use a special key like
<Tab>, you must escape it like in the example below.

Example: >
  let g:contextcomplete_trigger = '\<Tab>'
<
